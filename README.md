**Hi! I'm Kinga 😊** 

I'm learning how to use Artificial Intelligence to help people with mental health problems 👩‍💻🧠  

Right now, I'm learning Python and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn and Matplotlib 🐼📊

And make a lot of things just for fun :)

I believe technology can make life better 💙
