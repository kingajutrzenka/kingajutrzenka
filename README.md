**Hi! I'm Kinga 😊**

I'm a first-year Applied Mathematics student at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.
I'm exploring the field of Machine Learning, with a particular focus on algorithms like LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and DBSCAN.

I take part in Kaggle competitions and treat them as a way to learn, experiment, and grow as a future data scientist.
I'm especially curious about how technology can be used for good. 🌱

Right now, I’m focusing on building a strong foundation in Python, NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

Math meets machine learning — and I’m here for it. 🤍

Feel free to message me — I love exchanging ideas and experiences! 💬
