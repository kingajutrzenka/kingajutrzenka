**Hi, I’m Kinga 🙂**

I’m a first-year Applied Mathematics student at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń 🎓

This GitHub is where I keep the things I’m learning and working on while figuring out programming, machine learning, and how math shows up in code.

Right now, I’m mostly:
- learning the basics of ML algorithms,
- trying to understand data and models instead of just using libraries,
- writing code, breaking it, and fixing it again.

Some of the projects here are from earlier stages. They’re not meant to be perfect - they show what I was learning at the time.

I’m curious about using AI in a thoughtful and responsible way 🌱

This profile will probably change as I learn more.
Feel free to reach out 🙂
