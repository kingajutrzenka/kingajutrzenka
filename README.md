**Hi! I'm Kinga 😊!**
I'm a first-year Applied Mathematics student at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.
I'm exploring the fields of Machine Learning and I'm learning to create VR experiences as a member of the University Cognitive Science Club (UKK).

In my free time (though I don’t have much of it now 😜), I take part in Kaggle competitions, work on projects, and grow as a future AI engineer.

I'm especially curious about tech for good. 🌱🐴👩🏻

Feel free to message me!
